config OCF_OCF
	tristate "OCF (Open Cryptograhic Framework)"
	help
	  A linux port of the OpenBSD/FreeBSD crypto framework.

config OCF_CRYPTODEV
	tristate "cryptodev (user space support)"
	depends on OCF_OCF
	help
	  The user space API to access crypto hardware.

config OCF_RANDOMHARVEST
	tristate "crypto random --- harvest entropy for /dev/random"
	depends on OCF_OCF
	help
	  Includes code to harvest random numbers from devices that support it.
          Currently requires patch to drivers/char/random.c

config OCF_FIPS
	tristate "enable fips RNG checks"
	depends on OCF_OCF && OCF_RANDOMHARVEST
	help
	  Run all RNG provided data through a fips check before
	  adding it /dev/random's entropy pool.

config OCF_CRYPTOSOFT
	tristate "cryptosoft (software crypto engine)"
	depends on CRYPTO && OCF_OCF
	help
	  A software driver for the OCF framework that uses
	  the kernel CryptoAPI.

config OCF_CRYPTOSOFT_DEBUG_COUNTERS
	bool "enable debug counters for cryptosoft usage"
	depends on OCF_CRYPTOSOFT && DEBUG_FS
	help
	  This option adds several counters into debugfs /cryptosoft
          that are incremented for each operation performed by software.
	  Used for testing and debugging.

config OCF_SAFE
	tristate "safenet (HW crypto engine)"
	depends on OCF_OCF
	help
	  A driver for a number of the safenet Excel crypto accelerators.
	  Currently tested and working on the 1141 and 1741.

config OCF_IXP4XX
	tristate "IXP4xx (HW crypto engine)"
	depends on OCF_OCF && ARM
	help
	  XScale IXP4xx crypto accelerator driver.  Requires the
	  Intel Access library.

config OCF_HIFN
	tristate "Hifn Vulcan (HW crypto engine)"
	depends on OCF_OCF
	help
	  OCF driver for various HIFN based crypto accelerators (VULCAN)
	  (7951, 7955, 7956, 7751, 7811)

config OCF_HIFN_PKMMAP
	bool "Hifn Vulcan mmap interface (/dev/vulcanpk)"
	depends on OCF_HIFN
	help
	  Enables direct access to the vulcan PK engine via /dev/vulcanpk.
          Turning this on disables the OCF interface for the PK engine.

config OCF_HIFN_DEBUG_COUNTERS
	bool "enable debug counters for hifn chip usage"
	depends on OCF_HIFN && DEBUG_FS
	help
	  This option adds several counters into debugfs /hifn that 
          are incremented for each operation performed by this hardware.
	  Used for testing and debugging.

config OCF_HIFNHIPP
	tristate "Hifn HIPP (HW packet crypto engine)"
	depends on OCF_OCF
	help
	  OCF driver for various HIFN based crypto accelerators (HIPP)
	  (7855)

config OCF_BENCH
	tristate "ocf-bench (HW crypto in-kernel benchmark)"
	depends on OCF_OCF
	help
	  A very simple encryption test for the in-kernel interface
	  of OCF.  Also includes code to benchmark the IXP Access library
	  for comparison. This code is mutually exclusive with actually
	  using OCF for IPsec or SSL.

config OCF_OCFNULL
        tristate "ocf-null (Measuring protocol chaining overhead)"
        depends on OCF_OCF
        help
          A very simple implementation where everything of IPsec protocol
          chain is processed, except for crypto operation.

config OCF_PROFILE
	bool "OCF operation profiling"
	depends on OCF_OCF && X86_TSC
	help
	  Keep track of how much time is spent in each state of the OCF engine.
          Report min/avarage/max values in /sysfs.
